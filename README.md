# Moddable Platformer

This mini moddable game project by [Endless OS
Foundation](https://endlessos.org) is intended to help ease the learning curve
into Godot.

This sample project allows learners to engage with game creation concepts,
applying various modifications to the game itself, all without reading or
writing any code.

The `doc/MODS.md` file details the mods that have been made available.
